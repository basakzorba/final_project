# General Biology Quiz - Final Project

This is a web-based python application that is designed for users to input their answers and see their results about general biology terms. This app runs on the local host with the port 5002. Therefore the address you need to connect is as follows.

    127.0.0.1:5002


In order to run this app on local host, the Flask and Jinja2 libraries are needed to be installed with the following command.

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Lastly, the main code should be run with the following python command.

    python3 main.py

Now it is possible to observe the webpage on the localhost (127.0.0.1:5002).
